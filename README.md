# eBookMetaEditor

A TUI built in Rust for batch and individual editing of eBook metadata to make grouping and sorting books by series simpler.

## Running

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/EonMurph/eBookMetaEditor.git`.
2. Run the project using `cargo run --release`.
3. Alternatively you can build the project using `cargo build --release`,<br>then move to a directory with your epubs and run the release from there using `<path to eBookMetaEditor clone>/target/release/ebook_meta_editor`.

(Mostly done, just need to refactor code for safety)
